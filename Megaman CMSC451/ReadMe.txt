Implementations:
______________________________________________________________
Animation/Sprites: 
	- Downloaded a full sprite sheet online
	- Modified (cut out) each sprite and made a file
	  containing all the appropriate sprites to simulate
	  a movement.
	- Added transparency.
	- Had to position each sprite in the correct position
	  in the frame
	- Animated using openGL texture mapping on GL_POLYGON

Bugs:
______________________________________________________________
Animation:
	- Stand Animation is not smoove
	- Run animation has some kind of white line on top
	- Need to fix animation timings (some frames should
	  be displayed longer than other frames).
